        <a href = "day6/day6.html"><h3 id="day4">Day 6: Youtuber Subscriber Count</h3></a>
        <h4>May 1<sup>st</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>Okay. So today I had to have a friend help me out for this project. Finally, I got the YouTube API working, but I needed help. Turns out it actually wansn't that hard or complicated as I thought it would be. There's just some base code you always have to implement and then the rest is just straight forward parsing. Since I need to sleep and my first day of work is tomorrow, I just made it so that when you display a channel name, it dispalys the subsriber count for that channel.
            </p>
        
        <p>
        Now that I have the basic knowledge of how to work with APIs, expect cooler and bigger projects to come! Peace. 5/100.

        <h4>April 30<sup>th</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>I know a better project was promised. But I'm having trouble managing my time. I'm going to be working on the bigger project little by little as the days go by. So today I decided to work with the mouse events. I learned
            </p>
        
        <p>-> how to work with mouse events <br> -> update mouse coordinates live <br>-> how to activate a javascript function without declaring one in the HTML file <br>-> how to make custom cursor images </p>

        <h4>April 29<sup>th</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>When you have too much friends you don't have enough time to work on things. Just kidding, but seriously I was pretty much out the whole day. I had  big project planned but by the time came back I didn't have enough time to figure out the things for my project. But good news is I know exactly what I'm going to do tomorrow so I don't have to spend time researching what to do next.</p>
        
        <p>I did today's website in literally 1 hour. For this website I </p>
        <p>-> played with input forms <br> -> learned how to call a function by pressing a key <br> -> worked with arrays</p>
        <p>I learned some new things although it wasn't much. The next one will be better, I promise. </p>

        <a href = "day3/day3.html"><h3 id="day2">Day 3: Random Color Generator</h3></a>
        <h4>April 28<sup>th</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>Okay, so here's the thing. I spent a lot of my day playing with various web stuff such as node.js and APIs cause I thought it was pretty interesting. Since I'm going to have to spend a lot more time than one whole day, I opted to do something simple to allocate time to learn more things for future websites. During the next few days I hope to learn more about APIs and how to implement them. </p> 
        <p>So yeah, today I did a background color generater that displayed the hex number of the color to go along with it. It was pretty cool since to generate the random hex number I used some java knowledge from before, 
            
            <xmp> 
                function randomColor() {
                var letters = "0123456789ABCDEF".split("");
    var color = "#";
    
    for (var i =0; i 'less than' 6; i++) {
       
        color += letters[Math.floor(Math.random()*16)];
        }
                
    }</xmp></p>
        
        <p>What could I learn from something so simple? Well...</p>
        <p>-> var in JS as arrays <br> -> .split() is a thing in JS <br> -> making a whole page clickable by setting an id for body <br> -> changing .css elements from JS <br> -> start a function upon page load </p>
        
        <p>For later days I aim to do some animation, working with canvas and APIs.</p>

        <a href = "day2/day2.html"><h3 id="day2">Day 2: Click Race</h3></a>
        <h4>April 27<sup>th</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>I had a lot of fun with this one. This is mainly because I figured out almost all of the Javascript part by myself, confirming my understanding! :) However, I took the easy way out of the things I wanted to do.</p>
        
        <p>At first I was going to make a calculator which seemed and sounded easy enough. But what I couldn't do for the life of me was format my circle calculator buttons to a 3X3 grid format. When I went to the internet for help all I got were information on formatting for basic boring buttons, or a new thing I just found out about called Sass with the file format (.scss). After looking at sample code for it, which was filled with $ and brackets at the most random places, I stopped. I just copied and paste the code into my files. However, I learned that I needed some compiler for .scss files to work with my HTML files. So I downloaded Ruby and Rubygem onto my VPS and my computer, to download Sass. After another hour of downloading, that didn't work. So I quit. Spent way too much time on something that I wasn't feeling on learning right now. So I went about searching for a new somewhat straight forward project to work on.</p>
        
        <p>Inspired by Jennifer Dewalt, I decided to make a clicking game where you click as fast as you can within a certain time limit. At first I was trying to make a cool <font face = "monospace"><a href ="http://codepen.io/HugoGiraudel/pen/BHEwo">timer</a></font> I found on codepen.io but I found out that it required Sass. After browsing through the designs on codepen.io. I found that everything that looks cool requires Sass. Looks like I'm putthing that on the list to learn. So yeah, I quit the cool timer idea and went for the simple number countdown. Had fun playing with the JS and nested functions. From all this I learned:</p>
        
        <p>-> how to work with the setInterval() funcion for timings<br>-> how to reload/reset the page, which I can now implement for my first site<br>-> solidified my undestanding for JS<br></p>
        
        <p>I am most definitly going to learn Sass at some point, maybe for my 5th day I will. Until next time, PEACE! Finished 2<sup>nd</sup>.</p>

        <!-- Day 1-->
        <a href = "day1/day1.html"><h3 id="day1">Day 1: Reaction Time</h3></a>
        <h4>April 26<sup>th</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>Oh boy did this take a while. Today I decided to work with graphics and mouse events. Turned out I'm learning much more than I expected, since I also have to work with Javascript. I don't know why but Javascript just seemed confusing to me as I didn't know how it linked with the HTML or CSS files. The graphics and mouse events were pretty straight forward, but the stopwatch time itself was the hardest.</p>
        <p>Oh well, at the end of the day, I learned how to <br>-> link HTML and JS code together <br> -> functions in JS <br> -> mouse events <br> -> import fonts from Google fonts API <br> -> graphics  </p>
        
        <p>This website was pretty frustrating and I was going to switch onto an easier idea and save this for a later date. But then part of me was too lazy to even think of another idea... so I just stuck with it. As you can tell this website serves no purpose and is actually incredibly useless. I was going to implement it to be like a game so that the closer you at to .000 you get a score, but I didn't have enough time. So I guess I'll save that for another day. Good news, 1/100 finished.</p>

       <h3 id="day0">Day 0: Setting up this site</h3>
        <h4>April 25<sup>th</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>Setting up everything for the site took me a whole day, although it was decently straight forward.</p>
       
        <p>My website was hosted on my friend's server at first and I decided it was time for me to get my own.</p> 
        
        <p> -> I used <font face = "monospace"><a href = "https://www.digitalocean.com">digital ocean</a></font> as my server <br> -> For the image I used the latest version of Ubuntu. <br> -> To start off I installed LAMP onto my VPS <br> -> I directed my domain servers on godaddy from my friend's to digital oceans' <br> -> Then I installed a FTP called <font face = "monospace"><a href = "https://filezilla-project.org">Filezilla</a></font> <br> -> Connected to my host server through Filezilla then dragged my HTML and CSS files into the directory /var/www/html/ (took longest to figure out...) <br> -> done. </p> 
        <p>I encountered so many problems. At first I kept on installing and doing things that I actually didn't need which ended making things more complicated than neccessary. Then when I got to the FTP it took me a while to figure out how to connect to the server and which directory to drag my files to. <br><br> Lesson is to read the instructions slowly and don't rush.   </p>
