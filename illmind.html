        <h4>April 26<sup>th</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>Oh boy did this take a while. Today I decided to work with graphics and mouse events. Turned out I'm learning much more than I expected, since I also have to work with Javascript. I don't know why but Javascript just seemed confusing to me as I didn't know how it linked with the HTML or CSS files. The graphics and mouse events were pretty straight forward, but the stopwatch time itself was the hardest.</p>
        <p>Oh well, at the end of the day, I learned how to <br>-> link HTML and JS code together <br> -> functions in JS <br> -> mouse events <br> -> import fonts from Google fonts API <br> -> graphics  </p>
        
        <p>This website was pretty frustrating and I was going to switch onto an easier idea and save this for a later date. But then part of me was too lazy to even think of another idea... so I just stuck with it. 1/100 finished.</p>

       <h3 id="day0">Day 0: Setting up this site</h3>
        <h4>April 25<sup>th</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>Setting up everything for the site took me a whole day, although it was decently straight forward.</p>
       
        <p>My website was hosted on my friend's server at first and I decided it was time for me to get my own.</p> 
        
        <p> -> I used <font face = "monospace"><a href = "https://www.digitalocean.com">digital ocean</a></font> as my server <br> -> For the image I used the latest version of Ubuntu. <br> -> To start off I installed LAMP onto my VPS <br> -> I directed my domain servers on godaddy from my friend's to digital oceans' <br> -> Then I installed a FTP called <font face = "monospace"><a href = "https://filezilla-project.org">Filezilla</a></font> <br> -> Connected to my host server through Filezilla then dragged my HTML and CSS files into the directory /var/www/html/ (took longest to figure out...) <br> -> done. </p> 
        <p>I encountered so many problems. At first I kept on installing and doing things that I actually didn't need which ended making things more complicated than neccessary. Then when I got to the FTP it took me a while to figure out how to connect to the server and which directory to drag my files to. <br><br> Lesson is to read the instructions slowly and don't rush.   </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <h4>April 25<sup>th</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>So... this is my first entry into my "blog." As the title states this is where I talk about my thoughts inside my head. About things that I've been through, advice, etc. <br><br> Starting today April 25<sup>th</sup> 2014, I'm going to be starting a 100 website challenge where I do one website a day for 100 days. </p>
