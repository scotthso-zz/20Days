    <h1>SCOTT SO</h1>
    <h4>EST. 1995</h4>
    <br>
    <p>My name is Scott So and I am a Software Engineer at the University of Waterloo. I used to be a competitive swimmer until school work took over. I play the guitar and I used to play the piano. I am a huge NBA fan and I love Jeremy Lin and his story. I have travelled to Kenya and South Africa to help out with less fortunate children by painting classrooms, tutoring them in English and constructing building foundations. I am an aspiring entrepreneur hoping to start my own company before I graduate. I love programming and I am comfortable with Java, C and C++. Right now I am focusing on learning how to develop applications for Android devices. I love designing, drawing and photography. Check out my gallery, which is only a small portion of my work as I lost all my files a while back… One day I wish to leave my legacy behind…</p>
