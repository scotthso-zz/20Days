            <p>Rap has always been a controversal topic. </p>
            <br>
            <p>However, that is mainly due to one genre of hip hop music, which is "Gangsta rap."</p>
    
    <p>Gangsta rap is a subgenre of hip hop music popularized by rap groups such as N.W.A. The lyrics were extremely controversal as they promoted crime, violence, sex, racism, drugs and many more. <br>
        
        The reason it became so popular was because it was so commericially lucrative. </p>
                
        <p>
       
        As time went on, the style and flow of Gangsta rap became less hardcore and more laid back. R&amp;B hooks became more popular but the lyrics were still promoting money, sex and drugs. 
                
    </p>
                
                <p>People also find Rap to be lame and talentless, as all people do is talk over a beat. However, rap is much more than that. </p>
    
                <p>Rap involves complicated rhyming schemes and clever play on words. It's also a whole community with songs that insult other rappers or tell a story. </p>
