            <p>Imagine a world where there was no reward for what you do.</p>
                <p>You don't get a raise from a promotion.
                    <br>
                    You don't get a bonus for working overtime. 
                    <br>
                    You just don't get anything at the end of the day.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        <b>Would you still be doing what you're doing now?</b>
                </p>
                
                <p>You wouldn't.
                    <br>
                    During this day and age, we are so blinded by money and societal success that we never stop and think, "Am I happy with what I'm doing?" Do you go to work in the morning excited and happy, not because of the free food, free massages, and free dry cleaning? </p>
                     
                <p>Forbes magazine reported that 70% of a company's employees hate their jobs. In the U.S. with an unemployment rate of 7.8%, more than 2 millions Americans quit their jobs every MONTH.</p>
                
                <p>Out of the 70%: </p>
                <p>31% Don't like their boss
                <br>
                31% A lack of empowerment
                <br>
                35% Internal politics
                <br>
                43% Lack of recognition 
                </p>
                
                <p>Dentists and other health physicians have some of the highest suicide rates over all other professions. </p>
                  
                <p>People hear about all these high-paying jobs, "Doctors, Programmers, Investment Banker etc..." and they immediately want to pursue it. But when they actually start practising their profession they realize it doesn't make them happy.</p>
                
                
                <p>However, I am guilty of this myself. The only reason why I went into Software Engineering over all the other programs is the thought of working for high-profile companies such as Google or Facebook. Never once did I consider, do I actually enjoy learning this stuff. 
                 <br>   
                    
                    I mean this is my future career we're talking about here and as soon as my offer came in, I didn't hesitate to click the accept button.</p>
                
                <p>One time I was with a good friend of mine and we were talking about our dream home when we get rich. Out of the blue this guy was like 
                    <br>
                    <i>Ya I just want a room where I mount beautiful code on the walls.</i>
                    <br>
                    What...? <br>
                    <i>Ya, just elegant code. A room of code.</i>
                <br>
                    Thats when it hit me that I didn't love programming. I liked it, but I wasn't that passionate about it. This guy loved it.
                </p>
                
                <p>Even though I realized that, I couldn't turn around. 
                    <br>
                    The first reason being I still didn't know what my passion was.
                    <br>
                    The second reason was that I felt like and I still feel like that I've committed too much.
                    <br>
                    The third reason being that I didn't actually hate programming. It was okay and enjoyable at times.
                    <br>
                    The last being programming will be a promising career. 
                </p>
                
                <p>But as University classes went on, I felt more out of place. People coded for fun. Did contest problems in their spare time. Talked enthusiastically about code during lunch breaks. 
                    <br>
                And at the end of the day, I didn't end up doing well in terms of grades and got a co-op job not because of my skill, but rather through connections.
                </p>
                
                <p>This is when I question myself... is it really worth it?
                
                </p>
                
                <p>Don't worry. Since then I've found programming and designing apps or webpages something that I enjoy.</p>
                
                
                <p>Now if everyone in the world did what they were most passionate about, imagine how much better our world would be. People would be quitting their jobs and doing their own things that they were too afraid to do. </p>
                
                <p>Wannabe chefs would have started their own restaurants. More startups would be founded. Amazing paintings and music would be created. Great architecural wonders made. The world would revolutionize to become an ever greater place than today.</p>
                
                <p>Don't let greed or societal status blind your judgement. Do what you do best.</p>
