            <p>Imagine a world where there was no reward for what you do.</p>
                <p>You don't get a raise from a promotion.
                    <br>
                    You don't get a bonus for working overtime. 
                    <br>
                    You just don't get anything at the end of the day.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        <b>Would you still be doing what you're doing now?</b>
                </p>
                
                <p>You wouldn't.
                    <br>
                    During this day and age, we are so blinded by money and societal success that we never stop and think, "Am I happy with what I'm doing?". Do you go to work in the morning excited and happy, not because of the free food, massages, insurance and dry cleaning? </p>
                
                
                <p>If I asked you why you wanted to be a doctor what would you say?
                
                    <br>
                    <i>Oh I just want to help those who are sick.</i>
                    
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I call bullshit. If doctors made below the average annual salary would you still be saying the same thing?
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Of course a lot of you do truly believe in "helping others." 
                </p>
                
                    <p>
                    People hear about all these high-paying jobs, "Doctors, Programmers, Investment Banker etc..." and they immediately want to pursue it.</p>
                
                <p>However, I am guilty of this myself. The only reason why I went into Software Engineering over all the other programs is the thought of working for high-profile companies such as Google or Facebook. Never once did I consider, do I actually enjoy learning this stuff. 
                    
                    
                    I mean this is my future career we're talking about here and as soon as my offer came in, I didn't hesitate to click the accept button.</p>
                
                <p>One time I was with a good friend of mine and we were talking about our dream home when we get rich. Out of the blue this guy was like 
                    <br>
                    <i>Ya I just want a room where I mount beautiful code on the walls.</i>
                    <br>
                    To which I was like what? <br>
                    <i>Ya, just elegant code. A room of code.</i>
                <br>
                    Thats when it hit me that I didn't love programming. I liked it, but I wasn't that passionate about it. This guy was.
                
                </p>
                
                <b><p>Now if everyone in the world did what they were most passionate about, imagine how much better our world would be. </p></b>
