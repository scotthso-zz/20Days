        <h4>May 21<sup>st</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>I am going to be trying to figure out a big side project that covers mysql, php and what not. So hopefully this works out. If it doesn't I will continue to this. In the mean time I will try and get a site up occasionally in between my big project. Lets do this.  </p>
        <br>
        <!-- Day 24-->
        <h3 id ="day24">Didn't make it in time</h3>
        <h4>May 20<sup>th</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>Ugh. I am really dissappointed in myself. I got an idea going. I wanted to work with local storage, but the site wasn't working and I couldn't debug it in time. I need to get my shit together.   </p>
        <br>
        <!-- Day 23-->
        <h3 id ="day23">Break/Update</h3>
        <h4>May 18<sup>th</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>With how my schedule is looking right now, this is how I'm going to do it. I'm not going to do a website a day for 100 days in a row, unless I keep on making half assed websites like the world clock. I'm gonna do one everyday for the weekdays except for some holidays and then during the weekend I will work on a somewhat big one for monday. That way I can learn a lot more and get things done to accomodate for my busy schedule.</p>
        <p>On another note, I realized that I need to switch IDEs for a more "advanced" development working with php files and what not. I don't know why I'm telling you this. Thank you for your understanding.   </p>
        <br>

        <h4>May 15<sup>th</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>This one was really half-assed. Just simple JS, HTML and CSS. So yeah pretty much simple everything. </p>
        <p>Recently, with the projects that I've done, I have rarely been searching online for help. At this point, I feel like I've done enough to feel like I'm decently fluent in HTML, CSS and JS, with a little hint of JQuery. So I'm ready to start going on and learning some new stuff like node.js, angular.js or django.</p>
        <p>I'm thinking for tomorrow's project I'm going to just redesign another one of my pages to go along with my "theme". I know I've been slacking a lot but I've been really busy with my jobs and my other side ventures. Wish me luck! Wow, 1/5 done!</p>
        <br>

        <h4>May 13<sup>th</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>Copied the same design for the home page for the sub-pages. Man CSS is powerful.</p>
        <br>
        <!-- Day 17-->
        <a href = "index.html"><h3 id ="day17">Day 17: Home Page V2</h3></a>
        <h4>May 12<sup>th</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>I was sick of staring at my home page. It was way too minimalistic. So I redesigned it to show my 'creative' side. I learned a lot from this by looking at page sources from various websites. The potential of html divs mixed with css is amazing. I did all this without bootstrap. Suck it twitter. I'm still not done as I'm going to be redisigning the whole site and all the pages. So the next few days I'm going to be redesigning the pages as my daily projects. </p>

        <h4>May 11<sup>th</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>I hate formatting. So today I decided to work with jQuery. After a while of fidgeting and playing around I learned that you actually had to import a jQuery library. I know, I'm pretty dumb. So yeah, I did something really simple just made a few squares fade in and out. jQuery seems really cool and I feel like I will have fun with it.</p> 
        
    <p> I created this site to remind you what the primary colours looked like just in case you forgot. Your welcome! </p>

        <h4>May 9<sup>th</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>I was pretty busy today with a school event. So I just decided to build on top of day 12's site and decided to display a time for different cities. Today's is extremely bad and simple. You might think that I haven't learned anything but actually I learned how to load javascript functions after div classes. Thank you.</p>

        <h4>May 8<sup>th</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>I saw that it was the 13<sup>th</sup> day so I was immediately reminded of Friday the 13<sup>th</sup>. I wanted to do something scary so what else then the classic timed scare site. At this point I'm just doing creative things with all the basic skills I've learned so far for the next couple of days. Then I'm going to advance and work with new things such as jquery, php or sockets. </p>
        <p>Ya, so on another note. I used Google Webmaster Tools to self-index my site with Gooogle. Also added a script onto my home page so that Google can track my site traffic. As if there is any... so sad :(</p>

        <h4>May 7<sup>th</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>Ugh. Literally just a clock. No time today because I was just playing with stuff and none of it worked out. Then there's work and stuff and I wanted to draw. So I just did a filler... Got to pick it up though. Disgusting behaviour on my part.</p>

        <h4>May 6<sup>th</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>I worked with the Harper Collins API today. Something new and simple that I learned today is that if you call a .css file that doesn't have anything in it, apparenlty the page just doesn't load... I think! Unless I overlooked something else. Anyways when you put in the input it takes so long for it to output. My guess is that since the JSON is so big, it takes a while for it to load and parse through it. 11/100. Let's go!</p>

        <h4>May 5<sup>th</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>After some thought into my schedule throughout the months, I calculated that I would have around 2-4 hours a day on my web pages. So don't expect anything super big or complicated for a while.</p>
        
        <p>For some reason I thought that animations would be really complicated but they're actually really simple. I got inspired by a codepen project for this one. Decided to start off with simple translations for each circle.   </p>
        
        <p>-> worked with -webkit-animation, the moz animation and the web animation. (Barely anyone uses -moz anymore) <br>-> specifically translations <br>-> even more specifically scales, diagonals, up, down, left and right</p>
        <br>

        <h4>May the fourth be with you 2014</h4>
        <p>I started working with the Google Maps API so I could be familiar with it for future projects and I am incredibly excited. There are SO MANY features on there. All I did was just automatically find the users location by longtitude and latitude and display it on the map with the classic Google Maps red pin. I was blown away by how accuracte the location was... but what do you expect? It's Google. So yeah, I was playing around with it and decided to keep today's website simple and straightforward for now. </p> 
        <p> The funniest thing is the hardest part about today's project was formatting the headers and divs to be on the same line.</p>

        <h4>May 3<sup>rd</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>Today is like my chill day. I got really excited about something that I am going to be working on I focused a lot of time on that. So for today's site I played with getting user permission to access their webcam by using navigation.getUserMedia. Wasn't that hard to figure out and was pretty simple. Baby steps.</p>

        <h4>May 2<sup>nd</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>I coded this site while being incredibly hungry. So forgive me for the little bugs it has. So for some reason out of nowhere I thought it would be cool to work with charts. So I used the library Chart.js. The webpage looked super clean and awesome which got me way more excited to use it. The library was easy to use with simple and straight forward code, creating even nice charts. I learned 
            </p>
        
        <p>
        -> how to implement a library in JS
        -> how to use Charts.js
        -> styling and using selectors
        -> styling and using actual pre-built buttons
        </p>
        
        <p> This was fun with implementing the library. Expect another API implementation coming soon!</p>

         <!-- Day 6-->
        <a href = "day6/day6.html"><h3 id="day6">Day 6: Youtuber Subscriber Count</h3></a>
        <h4>May 1<sup>st</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>Okay. So today I had to have a friend help me out for this project. Finally, I got the YouTube API working, but I needed help. Turns out it actually wansn't that hard or complicated as I thought it would be. There's just some base code you always have to implement and then the rest is just straight forward parsing. Since I need to sleep and my first day of work is tomorrow, I just made it so that when you display a channel name, it dispalys the subsriber count for that channel.
            </p>
        
        <p>
        Now that I have the basic knowledge of how to work with APIs, expect cooler and bigger projects to come! Peace. 5/100.

        <h4>April 30<sup>th</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>I know a better project was promised. But I'm having trouble managing my time. I'm going to be working on the bigger project little by little as the days go by. So today I decided to work with the mouse events. I learned
            </p>
        
        <p>-> how to work with mouse events <br> -> update mouse coordinates live <br>-> how to activate a javascript function without declaring one in the HTML file <br>-> how to make custom cursor images </p>

        <h4>April 29<sup>th</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>When you have too much friends you don't have enough time to work on things. Just kidding, but seriously I was pretty much out the whole day. I had  big project planned but by the time came back I didn't have enough time to figure out the things for my project. But good news is I know exactly what I'm going to do tomorrow so I don't have to spend time researching what to do next.</p>
        
        <p>I did today's website in literally 1 hour. For this website I </p>
        <p>-> played with input forms <br> -> learned how to call a function by pressing a key <br> -> worked with arrays</p>
        <p>I learned some new things although it wasn't much. The next one will be better, I promise. </p>

        <!-- Day 3-->
        <a href = "day3/day3.html"><h3 id="day3">Day 3: Random Color Generator</h3></a>
        <h4>April 28<sup>th</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>Okay, so here's the thing. I spent a lot of my day playing with various web stuff such as node.js and APIs cause I thought it was pretty interesting. Since I'm going to have to spend a lot more time than one whole day, I opted to do something simple to allocate time to learn more things for future websites. During the next few days I hope to learn more about APIs and how to implement them. </p> 
        <p>So yeah, today I did a background color generater that displayed the hex number of the color to go along with it. It was pretty cool since to generate the random hex number I used some java knowledge from before, 
            
            <xmp> 
                function randomColor() {
                var letters = "0123456789ABCDEF".split("");
    var color = "#";
    
    for (var i =0; i 'less than' 6; i++) {
       
        color += letters[Math.floor(Math.random()*16)];
        }
                
    }</xmp></p>
        
        <p>What could I learn from something so simple? Well...</p>
        <p>-> var in JS as arrays <br> -> .split() is a thing in JS <br> -> making a whole page clickable by setting an id for body <br> -> changing .css elements from JS <br> -> start a function upon page load </p>
        
        <p>For later days I aim to do some animation, working with canvas and APIs.</p>

        <!-- Day 2-->
        <a href = "day2/day2.html"><h3 id="day2">Day 2: Click Race</h3></a>
        <h4>April 27<sup>th</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>I had a lot of fun with this one. This is mainly because I figured out almost all of the Javascript part by myself, confirming my understanding! :) However, I took the easy way out of the things I wanted to do.</p>
        
        <p>At first I was going to make a calculator which seemed and sounded easy enough. But what I couldn't do for the life of me was format my circle calculator buttons to a 3X3 grid format. When I went to the internet for help all I got were information on formatting for basic boring buttons, or a new thing I just found out about called Sass with the file format (.scss). After looking at sample code for it, which was filled with $ and brackets at the most random places, I stopped. I just copied and paste the code into my files. However, I learned that I needed some compiler for .scss files to work with my HTML files. So I downloaded Ruby and Rubygem onto my VPS and my computer, to download Sass. After another hour of downloading, that didn't work. So I quit. Spent way too much time on something that I wasn't feeling on learning right now. So I went about searching for a new somewhat straight forward project to work on.</p>
        
        <p>Inspired by Jennifer Dewalt, I decided to make a clicking game where you click as fast as you can within a certain time limit. At first I was trying to make a cool <font face = "monospace"><a href ="http://codepen.io/HugoGiraudel/pen/BHEwo">timer</a></font> I found on codepen.io but I found out that it required Sass. After browsing through the designs on codepen.io. I found that everything that looks cool requires Sass. Looks like I'm putthing that on the list to learn. So yeah, I quit the cool timer idea and went for the simple number countdown. Had fun playing with the JS and nested functions. From all this I learned:</p>
        
        <p>-> how to work with the setInterval() funcion for timings<br>-> how to reload/reset the page, which I can now implement for my first site<br>-> solidified my undestanding for JS<br></p>
        
        <p>I am most definitly going to learn Sass at some point, maybe for my 5th day I will. Until next time, PEACE! Finished 2<sup>nd</sup>.</p>

        <a href = "day1/day1.html"><h3 id="day1">Day 1: Reaction Time</h3></a>
        <h4>April 26<sup>th</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>Oh boy did this take a while. Today I decided to work with graphics and mouse events. Turned out I'm learning much more than I expected, since I also have to work with Javascript. I don't know why but Javascript just seemed confusing to me as I didn't know how it linked with the HTML or CSS files. The graphics and mouse events were pretty straight forward, but the stopwatch time itself was the hardest.</p>
        <p>Oh well, at the end of the day, I learned how to <br>-> link HTML and JS code together <br> -> functions in JS <br> -> mouse events <br> -> import fonts from Google fonts API <br> -> graphics  </p>
        
        <p>This website was pretty frustrating and I was going to switch onto an easier idea and save this for a later date. But then part of me was too lazy to even think of another idea... so I just stuck with it. As you can tell this website serves no purpose and is actually incredibly useless. I was going to implement it to be like a game so that the closer you at to .000 you get a score, but I didn't have enough time. So I guess I'll save that for another day. Good news, 1/100 finished.</p>

        <h4>April 25<sup>th</sup> 2014</h4>
        <p>Setting up everything for the site took me a whole day, although it was decently straight forward.</p>
       
        <p>My website was hosted on my friend's server at first and I decided it was time for me to get my own.</p> 
        
        <p> -> I used <font face = "monospace"><a href = "https://www.digitalocean.com">digital ocean</a></font> as my server <br> -> For the image I used the latest version of Ubuntu. <br> -> To start off I installed LAMP onto my VPS <br> -> I directed my domain servers on godaddy from my friend's to digital oceans' <br> -> Then I installed a FTP called <font face = "monospace"><a href = "https://filezilla-project.org">Filezilla</a></font> <br> -> Connected to my host server through Filezilla then dragged my HTML and CSS files into the directory /var/www/html/ (took longest to figure out...) <br> -> done. </p> 
        <p>I encountered so many problems. At first I kept on installing and doing things that I actually didn't need which ended making things more complicated than neccessary. Then when I got to the FTP it took me a while to figure out how to connect to the server and which directory to drag my files to. <br><br> Lesson is to read the instructions slowly and don't rush.   </p>
